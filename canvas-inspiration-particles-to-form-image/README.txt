A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/haidang/pen/qORJbK.

 It's a canvas particles demo that form any images loaded by tag. But this demo is slow/stucked when the image size is large. You can switch or add image tag from html panel using any images that you prefer and see how it works! 
Any advices are welcome!!!
