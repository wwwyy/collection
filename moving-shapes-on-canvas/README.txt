A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/allanpope/pen/eNzNGV.

 Click around to change where shapes animate to.

First go at learning canvas. Followed Rachel Smith's blog article (http://codepen.io/rachsmith/blog/controlling-the-canvas-with-javascript-objects) on how to control the canvas using js objects.

Added squares, different sized circles, randomised some of the variables & on click changed where the shapes animate to.
