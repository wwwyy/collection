 I loved Virgil's Dribble shot and decided to remake it with some SVG animations :) I didn't really want to recreate the curvy line since I believe straight lines are more accurate. Sorry Virgil, I might make them curvy one day :)! With a bit of time on my hands I could make it even more detailed.
I hope you like it and post some feedback on how to make this better :)!
